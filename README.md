### Developer Breezy


## About Me
I've been developing for the past year now, I have grown to learn how to properly code over time but I orignally started by editing basic code, converting vehicles (on FiveM), editing .metas etc, essentially all the basic stuff that a regular developer needs to know. Over time, I learned different useful tips on how to code languages such as Lua. I've watched tutorials, learned from friends & fellow developers. I am now capable of fixing most broken scripts and creating scripts from scratch. I will always make room for improvement and always keep an open mind to learn more tips.
